              the review text (as a dependent variable) and the influence of product

              across the values of the review rating scale on a dataset consisting
              of N=667 products with a minimum number of 15 reviews per product. The

              opinion list that has been extracted from a large corpus of online
              consumer reviews gathered from the German site of Amazon (Amazon.de).

              experience goods receiving higher amounts of negative text in relation

  abstract  = {The well-known 3V architectural paradigm for Big Data introduced
              by Laney (2011) provides a simplified framework for defining the
              architecture of a big data platform to be deployed in various
              scenarios tackling processing of massive datasets. While additional
              components such as Variability and Veracity have been discussed as an
              extension to the 3V model, the basic components (Volume, Variety, and
              Velocity) provide a quantitative framework while varia-bility
              and veracity target a more qualitative approach. In this paper we
              argue why the basic 3V's are not equal due to the different
              requirements that need to be covered in case higher demands for a
              particular "V". Similar to other conjectures such as the CAP theorem,
              3V based architectures differ on their implementation. We call this
              paradigm heterogeneity and we provide a taxonomy of the existing tools
              (as of 2013) covering the Hadoop ecosystem from the perspective of
              heterogeneity. This paper contributes on the understanding of the
              Hadoop ecosystem from the perspective of different workloads and aims
              to help researchers and practitioners on the design of scalable
              platforms targeting different operational needs.},

      aspect of the medical profession. Regardless of whether this regulation
          derives from government sourced guidelines or materials from
          government-sponsored institutions, it results to a high production of
          information resources (institutional information resources) which are
          disseminated to the clinical stuff in order to ensure compliance. In
          that case the issue of credibility of this information resources might

      costs, energy consumption becomes a significant cost factor for the
          evaluation of data center operations. A significant contributor to
          that is the performance of database servers which are found to
          constitute the backbone of online services. From a software approach,
      while a set of novel data management technologies appear in the market
          e.g. key-value based or in-memory databases, classic relational
              database management systems (RDBMS) are still widely used. In
              addition from a hardware perspective, the majority of database
              servers is still using standard magnetic hard drives (HDDs)
              instead of solid state drives (SSDs) due to lower cost of storage
              per gigabyte, disregarding the performance boost that might be
              given due to high cost. In this study we focus on a software based
              assessment of the energy consumption of a database server by
              running three different and complete database workloads namely
              TCP-H, Star Schema Benchmark -SSB as well a modified benchmark we
              have derived for this study called W22. We profile the energy
              distribution among the most important server components and by
              using different resource allocation we assess the energy
              consumption of a typical open source RDBMS (PostgreSQL) on a
              standard server in relation with its performance (measured by
                      query time). Results confirm the well-known fact that even
              for complete workloads, optimization of the RDBMS results to lower
                  energy consumption.},

  abstract = {Taking a structuration perspective and integrating reciprocity
      research in economics, this study examines the dynamics of reciprocal
          interactions in social question & answer communities. We postulate
          that individual users of social Q&A constantly adjust their kindness
          in the direction of the observed benefit and effort of others.
          Collective reciprocity emerges from this pattern of conditional
          strategy of reciprocation and helps form a structure that guides the
          very interactions that give birth to the structure. Based on a large
          sample of data from Yahoo! Answers, our empirical analysis supports
          the collective reciprocity premise, showing that the more effort
          (relative to benefit) an asker contributes to the community, the more
          likely the community will return the favor. On the other hand, the
          more benefit (relative to effort) the asker takes from the community,
      the less likely the community will cooperate in terms of providing

          produced using a large number of product review titles providing a
          textual assessment and numerical star ratings from Amazon.de. As both,
      review titles and star ratings, can be regarded as a summary of the
          writers opinion concerning a product, they are strongly correlated.
          Thus, the opinion value for a given word or phrase is derived from the
          mean star rating of review titles which contain the word or phrase.
          The paper describes the calculation of the opinion values and the
          corrections which were necessary due to the so-called “Jshaped

  abstract  = {Online reviews have received much attention recently in the literature, as
                their visibility has been proven to play an important role during the
                purchase process. Furthermore, recent theoretical insight argue that the
                votes casted on how helpful an online review is (review helpfulness) are
                of particular importance, since they constitute a focal point for
                examining consumer decision making during the purchase process. In this
                paper, we explore the interplay between online review helpfulness,
                rating score and the qualitative characteristics of the review text as
                measured by readability tests. We construct a theoretical model based on
                three elements: conformity, understandability and expressiveness and we
                investigate the directional relationship between the
                qualitative characteristics of the review text, review
                helpfulness and the impact of review helpfulness on the
                review score. Furthermore, we examine whether this
                relation holds for extreme and moderate review scores.
                To validate this model we applied four basic readability
                measures to a dataset containing 37,221 reviews
                collected from Amazon UK, in order to determine the
                relationship between the percentage of helpful votes
                awarded to a review and the review text’s stylistic
                elements. We also investigated the interrelationships
                between extremely helpful and unhelpful reviews, as well
                as absolutely positive and negative reviews using
                intergroup comparisons. We found that review readability
                had a greater effect on the helpfulness ratio of a
                review than its length; in addition, extremely helpful
                reviews received a higher score than those considered
                less helpful. The present study contributes to the ever
                growing literature on on-line reviews by showing that
                readability tests demonstrate a directional relationship
                with average length reviews and their helpfulness and
                that this relationship holds both for moderate and

              mechanism for simultaneously checking the authenticity and degrees
              of similarity between different information objects, and present
              an empirical investigation of the method. A management scenario
              for the control of the authentication process and the detection of
              the degree of violation of documents is proposed.
              Findings – Such a mechanism could be adopted as a component of
              libraries’ strategy for the protection of the copyrights for
              documents published on the web.

                 somewhat blind to the consideration of the social context that surrounds
                 an information resource as a parameter that affects the precision of
                 the ranking in the query results. On the other hand that social

          ontologies in the context of e-learning. The overall objective is to
          emphasize the importance of analysing a phenomenon and reveal the
          descriptive conceptualizations that affect the employment of
          technology. Ontology as a term has an intrinsic holistic character and

          understanding the phenomenon of e-learning from several perspectives.

          issues are used for the description of the developmental process of
          the e-learning ontology entitled Multi-Dimensional Dynamic Learning
