## Research topics for MSc and PhD theses

### What can we learn by exploiting the velocity of blockchain transactions?

Blockchain transactions for several forms of cryptocurencies (bitcoin) take place 
in a blazing fast pace. What can we learn by studying the velocity of the 
blockchain transactions? Is market activity in blockchain transcations a good 
indication of economic activity? How do macroeconomic indicators affect their 
speed?

### Transaction repudation in blockchain protocols: The consumer side.

While a transaction in a normal currency is generally protected by 
repudation protocols, cryptocurencies represent a new appraoch on how 
repudation protocols are administered. Do consumers understand  

### Online consumer reviews 

There is a large body of literature that discusses how consumers read reviews
and decide to purchase a product. There are currently several meta-analyses 
who estimate the impact of the average star rating on sales elasticities for
particular categories of products. However what is relatively unknown are some
of the following questions: 

+ What is the mechanism behind the filtering and selection of reviews by
  consumers ? do consumers search reviews with the same intensity for 
  each product on their consideration set ? 

+ How does the rating environment (the variation of the ratings for a given
  product in the review aggregator) influence the reading propensity of the 
  consumer. 

### Does content still mater for review helpfulness ? 

In a previous work we showed that readability influences the review 
helpfulness. Several other studies have reached the same conclusion. However 
the cognitive mechanism of the willingness to cast a helpful vote is much more
complex and an understanding needs to be taken. 

### Algorithmic pricing and online reviews

+ How do prices influence the rating of a particular product and the 
  propensity to post a review ? 

### Fake reviews 
+ Do fake reviews really impact competition ? What is their real economic significance?
