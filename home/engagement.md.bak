I organize together with my colleague James Conford the <a
href="https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Norfolk/">Data Science Norfolk
Meetup</a> which is sponsored by AVIVA's data science unit. 

I have also worked as a consultant and senior data scientist for 
various companies in the automotive, banking and pharmaceutical industry. 
If you are working for an organization who is interested to work together on
driving insights from your data. 
I regularly conduct training clinics on data analytics with R and Python for a 
variety of research and corporate clients. If you need my help with advisory 
services or training do not hesitate to contact <a
