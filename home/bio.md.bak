# Biography

I am an Associate Professor (Senior Lecturer ) in Business Analytics at Norwich
Business School (NBS) of the University of East Anglia (UEA) where I am also a
member of the Innovation, Technology and Operations Management Group (ITOM). I
am also affiliated faculty with the Centre of Competition Policy (CCP). I am an
associate faculty member of the Big Data Laboratory of Goethe University
Frankfurt, Germany.

Before joining NBS, I worked as Senior Researcher at the Chair for Databases and
Information Systems at the Department of Informatics of the Goethe University
Frankfurt, Germany. I co-founded together with Professor Roberto Zicari the Big
Data Laboratory of the Goethe University (www.bigdata.uni-frankfurt.de) and I
acted as a Director for Analytics and Data Science. I also worked as an
Assistant Research Professor (Post.doc) at the Department of Economics of the
University of Copenhagen doing research in Experimental Economics 
and IT.

I completed my PhD in 2009 at Copenhagen Business School (CBS), Denmark under
the supervision of Prof. Volker Mahnke and I hold an MSc in Engineering from the
Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm with specialization in HCI &
Information Retrieval (2006). I completed my undergraduate studies at the Athens
University of Economics and Business (2004) and I have so far lived and worked
in 5 different countries (Greece, Sweden, Denmark, Germany and UK).

I have also acted professionally as a data scientist in various roles in the
industry working for one of the world’s largest car manufacturers and Germany’s
biggest lenders in use cases for big data and analytics. My main specialization
is in predictive analytics and in particular the transformation of Business
Intelligence and Data Warehousing to support competitive gain through analytical
maturity.

I am an active practitioner of analytical methods and tools aiming to increase
the impact of my research and some of my work has also been featured in the
German media (ARD, HR). I have worked closely with Adastra Germany a subsidiary
of Adastra Group (Canada) on developing practical use cases for analytics and
big data and have acted as a consultant senior data scientist in providing
training to an aspiring team of young data scientists engaged in various
projects.

I also contribute on the Operational Data Management Systems Portal
(www.odbms.org) which is an industry leading news hub for all things in Big
