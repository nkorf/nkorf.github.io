While a transaction in a normal currency is generally protected by repudiation protocols, cryptocurencies represent a new approach on how repudiation protocols are administered. Do consumers understand\nOnline consumer reviews There is a large body of literature that discusses how consumers read reviews and decide to purchase a product. There are currently several meta-analyses who estimate the impact of the average star rating on sales elasticities for particular categories of products. However what is relatively unknown are some of the following questions:\n  What is the mechanism behind the filtering and selection of reviews by consumers ? do consumers search reviews with the same intensity for each product on their consideration set ?\n  How does the rating environment (the variation of the ratings for a given product in the review aggregator) influence the reading propensity of the consumer.\n  Does content still mater for review helpfulness ? In a previous work we showed that readability influences the review helpfulness. Several other studies have reached the same conclusion. However the cognitive mechanism of the willingness to cast a helpful vote is much more complex and an understanding needs to be taken.\nAlgorithmic pricing and online reviews  How do prices influence the rating of a particular product and the propensity to post a review ?
